STEPS IN DATA PROCESSING FOR NCDB: ADJUVANT CHEMO

1. Extract data from the NCDB provided file.
	## Use python file rdatamaker.py based on fields in ncdbfields.csv
	
2. Create variable for median annual hospital-specific cystectomy volume.
	## Use python file ncdbvol.py based on cystectomy codes in cystcodes.csv

After creating above dataset, lines following executed via ncdbprocessing.py:

3. Restrict dataset to bladder cancer cases undergoing cystectomy. 
	## Cut is based on the cystectomy codes in the cystdict (cystcodes.csv)

4. Restrict dataset to pathologic stage >= pT3, or pN+
	## Cut is based on files included_path_t and included_path_n

5. Restrict dataset to only one cancer site
	## Only cases with sequence_number == 00 are included

6. Restrict dataset to transitional cell carcinoma.
	## Based on file included_hist.csv

7. Exclude patients receiving radiation therapy.
	## Only include if RX_SUMM_RADIATION == 0

8. Exclude patients dying within 30 days of surgery.
	## Only include if PUF_30_DAY_MORT_CD == 0

9. Exclude patients receiving neoadjuvant therapy and categorize into post-surgery or no chemo.
	## Only patients where RX_SUMM_SYSTEMIC_SUR_SEQ == 0 or 3
		## This only includes patients who received NO CHEMO or ADJUVANT CHEMO
		## which excludes RX_SUMM_SYSTEMIC_SUR_SEQ == 2, which is neoadjuvant chemo

10. Restrict post-surgery chemo group to those receiving chemo within 90 days of surgery.
