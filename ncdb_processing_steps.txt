STEPS IN DATA PROCESSING FOR NCDB: ADJUVANT CHEMO

1. Extract data from the NCDB provided file.
	## Code is ported from the SAS / SPSS file provided by NCDB PUF

2. Create variable for median annual hospital-specific cystectomy volume.

3. Restrict dataset to bladder cancer cases undergoing cystectomy. 
	## Cut is based on the cystectomy codes in the cystdict (cystcodes.csv)

    3a. If cystectomy was performed, create variable for diversion type.

4. Restrict dataset to pathologic stage >= pT3, or pN+
	## Cut is based on files included_path_t and included_path_n

6. Restrict dataset to transitional cell carcinoma.
	## Based on file included_hist.csv

7. Exclude patients receiving radiation therapy.
	## Only include if RX_SUMM_RADIATION == 0

8. Exclude patients dying within 30 days of surgery.
	## Only include if PUF_30_DAY_MORT_CD == 0

9. Exclude patients receiving neoadjuvant therapy and categorize into adjuvant or no chemo.
	I. Created variable for time from surgery to chemotherapy (DX_CHEMO_STARTED_DAYS - DX_DEFSURG_STARTED_DAYS) -> days_adjuvant_chemo
	II. Only included cases where RX_SUMM_CHEMO == '00' or days_adjuvant_chemo <= 90. 

10. Create variable for lymph node density.
	## lymph_node_density = REGIONAL_NODES_POSITIVE / REGIONAL_NODES_EXAMINED
