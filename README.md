## NCDB Volume Calculator

### This is code related to the National Cancer Database (NCDB) PUF file. The purpose is to:
* create a list of cystectomy procedure codes
* calculate yearly volume of cystectomies at each reporting facility
* calculate total volume of cystectomies at each reporting facility over the included years (1998-2011)

### Of note:
* the actual NCDB data has not been uploaded in accordance with PUF guidelines
* the included cystectomy codes can be changed in the cystcodes.csv file to alter which are included in calculating volume

### To be added (possibly):
* calculating yearly percentiles
* calculating total percentiles
* can base these off of published manuscripts (eg Birkmeyer NEJM 2003), or our own stats
